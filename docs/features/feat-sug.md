The next fields are used:

* `Label` is the Item label
* `Description` is the Item Description
* `Folder` indicates in what folder the Suggestion should be added
* `Password` is the Item Password
* `Comment` permits the originator of the Suggestion to give some inputs to the Validator

# Suggesting a modification of an existing Item

If the read-only user wants to suggest a modification, it is mandatory to:

* Use the **exact label of the existing Item**
* Select the **exact folder where the existing Item is stored**

Indeed, when a Suggestion is validated, Teampass checks if an existing Item already exist by using those 2 fields.

# Validate a Suggestion

Only a `Manager` or an `Administrator` can validate a Suggestion.

For this use the `thumb up icon` in front of the Suggestion you want to validate and to confirm your choice.
