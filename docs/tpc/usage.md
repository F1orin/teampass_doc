# Usage

## Basic usage

TeampassConnect has the ability to identify the website you are currently browsing and provide you the list of Items from Teampass database that could fit it.
This presents the advantage to automatically fill in the login form.

When browsing a website, TeampassConnect will show a badge indicating the number of Items related to it.
